Dear Elmer user,

We are pleased to announce the release of ElmerGUI, the new graphical user 
interface and pre-processor for Elmer.

The new pre-processor is intended to replace the old software component, 
ElmerFront, which is no longer supported.

Compared to ElmerFront, the new pre-processor has

o Enhanced mesh generation and mesh manipulation tools
o Enhanced visualization routines (based on OpenGL and extensions)
o Better compatibility with the latest Solver
o 100% programmable/customizable menu entries for equations, materials, 
etc.

ElmerGUI is able to utilize the following mesh generators:

o ElmerGrid (built-in)
o Netgen (plugin)
o Tetgen (plugin)

The source code of ElmerGUI is available from the subversion repository of 
project "elmerfem" at SF.net:

svn co https://elmerfem.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/elmerfem elmerfem

The source code and installation instructions can be found from the directory

elmerfem/trunk/misc/Mesh3D

Compilation instructions for the Netgen- and Tetgen-plugins can be found from 
the directories

elmerfem/trunk/misc/netgen_patches
elmerfem/trunk/misc/tetgen_patches

There is also a binary distribution available for Windows XP 
(Elmer-svn2997_gfortran.exe):

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=147815

The binary installer contains the Netgen-plugin for ElmerGUI. The 
Tetgen-plugin is not included in the
distribution (the user who wants to use Tetgen should consult Tetgen's site 
for a licence and compile the
plugin from source). Sample input files are available in the fdneut, grd, and 
stl subdirectories in

C:\Elmer5.4\samples\ElmerGUI\samples

A very small tutorial on the basic usage of ElmerGUI is available from the 
Wiki-pages at

http://elmerfem.wiki.sourceforge.net/

More detailed documentation and tutorials will follow.
