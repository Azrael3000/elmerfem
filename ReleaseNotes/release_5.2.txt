REALEASE NOTES FOR THE VERSION 5.2:

General features:
=================

o New keyword in Solver-section of sif file:
Start time = t
solver is activated only after simulation time (steady run step)
exceeds given value t.

o New keyword in Solver-section:
Timestep Scale = s
scale timestep for this solver by given value.

o New keyword in Solver-section:
Eigen System Shift = Real, default: 0
shift the spectrum by given value so that eigenvalues are
searched from vicinity of this value.

o New keyword in Solver-section:
Eigen System Compute Residuals = Logical, default: False
Compute and output residuals for the eigenvalue problem.

o New keyword in Solver-section:
Eigen System Lanczos Vectors = Integer, default: 3*eigenvalues+1
Give the number of Lanczos vectors to be generated by ARPACK, please
refer to ARPACK documentation.

o Periodic BC doesn't need to be explicitely translated to match the
periodic counterpart if corresponding boundaries are planar. This
case is now handled automatically.

o Dirichlets BCs may be given release conditions, f.ex.:

Temperature = 0
Temperature Condition = Variable time
Real MATC "if ( tx < release_time ) { 1 } { -1 }

Any Dirichlet BC may be acompanied by a condition: if positive
the Dirichlet BC is enforced, if negative relase the Dirhclet
setting and corresponding natrural BCs will apply.

o .sif-file parameter definitions may now use names 'timestep',
'timestep interval' and 'timestep size' as independent variable
names in addition to old choices of 'time' and solution field
names, .e.g.:

Viscosity = Variable timestep size
Real MATC "1/tx"

These new variable names are also available to the function
VariableGet().

o New syntax in the parameter definitions Variable-specifier allows
a parameter to depend on several independent variables. .f.ex.

Viscosity = Variable time,coordinate
Real MATC "tx(0)*sum(tx(1:3))"

The comma separated list of variables is seen by MATC as one array "tx"
of size n, where n is the total number of values in the independent 
variables.

Note that MATC indexing starts from zero, and coordinate array will always
be of size 3 regardless of the simulation dimension.

The same syntax applies to user forfran functions:

Viscosity = Variable time,displacement
Real Procedure "File" "Func"

FUNCTION Func(Model,n,t) RESULT(s)
TYPE(Model_t) :: Nodel
INTGER :: n
REAL(KIND=dp) :: t(*), s

s = t(1)*sum(t(2:4))
END FUNCTION Func

In Fortran the array indicies start from one, and the example case is
assumed to be in 3d (3 displacement values).

o New convenience functions in DefUtils module:
GetEdgeMap(), GetMatrix(), GetNOFBoundaryElements(), GetMesh(),
GetNOFActive(), GetSolver()

New application solvers included:
=================================
o Levelset solver
o Magnetostatics solver
o 1D Outlet boundary condition for arterial flow simulations.

Enhancements in application Solvers:
====================================

Navier-Stokes solver:
---------------------

- The classical P2/P1 stabilized element is implemented. The mesh bulk element
type needs to be one of (306, 408, 510, 613, 820) to use this stabilization.

- new keyword
Stabilization Method = [Stabilized,P2/P1,Bubbles]
this replaces old confusing uses of Stabilize and Bubbles keywords.

Heat Equation solver:
---------------------

- new keyword
Stabilization Method = [Stabilized,Bubbles]
this replaces old confusing uses of Stabilize and Bubbles keywords.

o new keyword
Heat Gap Implicit = Logical, default False
Treat heat gap boundary condition implicitely within the solver, making
the scheme solvable by one linear equation solve instead of iterating.

Stress Anylysis Solver:
-----------------------
o When computing thermal expansion Elmersolver versions 4 and above missed the
thermal strain when computing stresses. This was due to a rewrite the piece
of code that computes stresses from given displacement field. The term has
now been added again. The displacement state has not been affected by this 
in
any version.

o using p-elements with this solver should work (at least mostly)

Mesh Update Solver:
-------------------
o using p-elements with this solver should work

Helmholtz Solver:
----------------
o using p-elements with this solver should work

Electrostatics solver:
----------------------
o Possibility to include surface charge density among the results in
Electrostatics solver

Savedata:
---------
o SaveScalars and SaveLine will write data in separate files for each 
partition
when running in parallel

ElmerGrid:
==========

o Import of Comsol Multiphysics meshes
o Fusion of parallel Elmer results for postprosessing

Numerous other enhancements, test cases, bug fixes etc. are also included.
Hopefully only a few new bugs.

Enjoy, The Elmer Team
